# Are We Fast Yet?

- [Clone Object](src/benchmarks/clone-object/readme.md) - The purpose of this benchmark is to investigate which method of copying objects in Node.js is the fastest.
- [Find Element In](src/benchmarks/find-element-in/readme.md) - The purpose of the benchmark is to test how data access speed changes based on data structure used to store the data. I used array, record (object literal) and Map data structures in the benchmark.
- [Id Generators](src/benchmarks/id-generators/readme.md) - The purpose of this benchmark is to investigate the performance of different methods for generating IDs.
- [Json Validation](src/benchmarks/json-validation/readme.md) - This benchmark is designed to test which data validation library is the fastest.
- [String Types](src/benchmarks/string-types/readme.md) - The purpose of this benchmark is to investigate which method of string declaration is the fastest while performing operations on strings.
